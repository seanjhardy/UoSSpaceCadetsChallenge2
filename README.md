# UoSSpaceCadetsChallenge2
A simple IDE for the "barebones" language. Complete with a console, helpful error warnings, code highlighting, variables shown in the debugger, and a file naming, saving and loading system.

Disclamer: Some of these files were created by me before starting this project, and have since been ammended to include only methods relevant to this project
